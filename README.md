## _What_ does it do?

* This web app allows a barkeep to track and manage inventory for a hypothetical taproom. 

## _Why_ does it do?

* This project was prompted by the wonderful people at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/) as an exercise in building a basic React web app with a full CRUD interface. Additionally, it explores using one stateful component to manage local state and shared state among child components.
